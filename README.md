## Overview

### The challenge

In this project, main topic was about building out multi-step form as close to the design as possible.

### Functionalities

- Displaying multiple steps containing forms
- Going back to a previous step to update selections
- Displaying a summary of selections on the final step and confirming an order
- Receiving form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made
  - Phone number is not of a required length
- RWD
